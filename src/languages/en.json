  "History_article": "The saxophone is one of the few instruments in wide use today that were invented by a single individual. The inventer, Antoine-Joseph Sax (1814 - 1894), was known by his nickname 'Adolphe Sax', that is why it is called the saxophone. History tells us that Adolphe Sax was a musical instrument designer born in Dinant, Belgium who could play, design and create many windinstruments. His idea was to create an instrument that combined the best qualities of a woodwind instrument with the best qualities of a brass instrument,and in the 1840s he conceived the saxophone. This invention waspatented in Paris in 1846."
